## Java Exercise 01

An exercise for those learning to program in Java.

## Preparation

Before working on this exercise, do the following:
1. Check out the [master](https://github.com/LAUNCH-TEAM-6352/JavaExercise01/tree/master)
branch of the [JavaExercise01](https://github.com/LAUNCH-TEAM-6352/JavaExercise01)
repository to your local machine.
2. On your computer, create your own branch of the repository, naming the branch
**solution*YourName***. For example, **solutionJohnK**.
3. Push your branch up to GitHub.

Perform all subsequent work on your branch, frequently committing your changes
and pushing then to GitHub.

You can use a WPILib installation of Visual Studio Code to work
on your solution. Or, you can install the Visual Studio Code
Java Coding Pack using the installer found
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/installers).

## The Problem

In this exercise, replace the stub implementation of the `createSpiral(int, int)`
method with a full implementation as described in the method's doc comment.
Feel free to create additional classes that may help with your solution.

Use the provided `main(String[])` method to test your implementation.
In Visual Studio Code, a line containing `Run|Debug` should appear just
above the declaration of the `main` method. Click on `Run` to compile
and run your code.

When you have completed your solution besure to commit your latest changes
and push them to GitHub. Then notify Mr. Koehring, being sure to
tell him the name of your branch.
